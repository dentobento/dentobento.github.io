            You told me that "if you told me everything then i'd leave". To this let me tell you that You can tell me everything that has happened in your life until now and you don't need to be embarrassed, you don't have to fear or hide anything. I won’t judge you and I never will. I will only try to help you fix your problem that can be fixed, the rest is ok, I will just have to accept it as it is because I also have respect for you. Its Ok not To be Ok. You may say that everyone who came before said this, but I am not one of them. You know it in your heart if I'm true or not, even if you lie to yourself and try to run away you know what the truth is.
I'm not physically attracted to you. I'm attached to you because I can feel you were mistreated by people who came into your life, I can feel the pain inside you, I can feel those sorrows, I can see all those fallen tears, I can hear those silent screams, I can see those lonely sleepless nights, I can see how the light of hope within you slowly faded away, I can feel all your attempts go to waste to please them so that they'd show affection to you, I can hear those screams of despair, I can feel all those shaking helplessness, I can feel all those anxiety, I can hear all those voices that clouds your mind, I can feel all those attempts to feel numb from the pain that feels like a hole in your chest, I can feel all those moments when having faith felt useless waiting for the dawn that never came, I can feel the urge to run away because whatever you can't see feels like it can't hurt you. I can feel all of that pain and hurt you had to go through and still going through without you needing to explain them because I've been through all of those as well. I know these toxic feelings can't be explained to anyone except yourself. You talk to yourself about your issues in your head, making up scenarios because no one else will understand it. Even if we do try to explain it to people they just label it as us "not acting good". They expect us to act good when we can't, when its eating us alive inside, when its shaking our very core, when its making us question our very existence, when its making us feel like ending our existence for good. For them it's nothing, our suffering is a joke or a cry for attention.
Not only can I relate but I also understand the secret expectation deep inside for that significant other to just show up, end all of our misery and take us away to somewhere beautiful. And I also know that this expectation is what drives us. As it comes alive we are hopeful and as it dies we go through hell asking the question why, praying for the impossible not being able to see a way out even if we want to and sooner or later we try to numb it with drinking and smoking and it becomes a part of us, we think that’s all we are. The unworthy, the not good enough one, someone who doesn’t deserve anything good because it always goes bad. No one can talk us out of it, only because of the love we have for some very special people do we try to make an effort to get out of it but it isn’t just enough and it frustrates us and the circle starts once again.
I feel that I have to say this to you and remind you that, "affno lagi, affno khusi ko lagi affai le garne ho arule gardincha vanera assh gardine haina". Kasai ko maya ko karan, kasai ko aash ko karan hami jatti try garnu parne gardainau. We give up as soon as it becomes difficult and feel lost and unworthy.
 
The truth is that you were always more than good enough, you were perfect. You don’t have to feel unworthy and feel that you don’t deserve anything good. You have to stop saying that to yourself. The fault was never yours, it was and is still theirs for not being able to see what a beautiful person you're in the inside. You can talk and walk however cold and bitter you want, but I know it’s a fake wall you've kept up to keep away toxic people. It's your defense to protect yourself. I know because I've suffered and done the same.
As a kid I was loved but as I grew up, I was always compared to not only to my own sister's achievements but of everyone's. I used to have no idea what I did wrong. Gyani thye, padh thye, hasthye khelthye ramauthye kaile badmashi garina kaile kei naramro garina. Jati thulo hudai gaye I began to understand little by little, even before I knew I was expected to keep up the family name of being the best in everything. Win every gold medal, win every trophy, win every prize, win every contest. I was still a child, all I wanted was to be a child. Kotha baira niskina napaune, sathi sanga khelna nahunere, always study study study. I couldn't say no to anything being asked of me, because expectation thyonita maya paucha, affection paucha yedi maile yo garey vane vanera. I had to take part in every competition but I never won any trophy except one and it still wasn’t good enough. I wasn't allowed to take Opt.Math in class 9-10 cuz 8 ma percentage thorai ayo. Principal le diyena, ghar ma aama ra dd le toll tharkine gari natak gareko. I wasn't good enough vanera aba sabb lai halla gareko jasto vo tyo din. "Opt.Math padhena vane Dr. padhnu paudaina, Dr. banena vaney paisa izzat hudaina". Dad ko sahara lina khojeko, I'm 28 now haven’t even hugged me once jhan tyo bela ta he just said "para ja ta mero najik na ayeja". I sad, I was crying and I couldn’t even leave the room. Studies ma navayeni aru kurama ma ramro chu ki ani dekhau chu ma dhyan gayo maile tyo pani sakina. Whatever I started I just couldn’t be good enough to stick to it.
That's how I feel about you right now, I feel like I'm not good enough to be with you and take care of you. Because instead of just enjoying the moment, I should have slowed down and dived in to understanding you better, discovering in detail about your emotions, listening to your fears, to your dreams, things that excite you and things that disturb you, just listen to your problems, talk to you about them and help you forget them and comfort you, make you feel safe, make you feel cared, make you feel loved, make you feel like the hard times are over. Should have made you feel that the journey the dark is over, the light at the end of the tunnel is visible. Our moment was good and I regret not making it even greater for you. I should have had slowed down, been more gentle with my feeling for you but instead I crashed in and it was too much for you that it triggered your past trauma, it scared you and that is not what I wanted to do you.
Just like you I'm was scared. I was scared that I might lose you. Scared that if don’t give then you'd leave. There are so many things I wished I could do differently when we met so that it would be even better and then I think about it again on how it make it even more better.
You told me a little about what you had to go through in life and in your past, and I tell you that they didn't know how to appreciate you. You were never the fault.
We met at a time when for me the storm was beginning its end and you became the light I was searching for. Little did I know at that time that for you the storm was getting worse. I felt like I need to help this person. And as we talked and shared our topics you opened up and at that moment I wanted nothing to do but hold you, protect you, care for you, fight anyone that will try to hurt you, give you more than every amount of love that was deprived from you from a very young age.
Me, I tried it all, even ending it but You, you are stronger than you know yourself to be yet you can't see it because of all the toxic situations you've been through, because of how you were treated and the only thing you know is being cold because that's all they gave and that all you thought you should learn in life. You poor thing you never go the chance to see the beauty of love. You seek attention very much to the point where you don't even realize what the intension is behind the attention they gave you. Everyone fed you lies to just own you, treat you like property. And you thought "something is better than nothing". And when that guy went away from your life it hurt like hell, nothing was making sense, already in a cold grey world uncomfortable world it just got even worse for you and then you saw hope in going abroad to try save yourself by flying off into the unknown. And that's when you met me.
You came as a light of hope signaling to me that it's over, the hard days are gone. To you, my actions were unexpected and swept you off at a time when you were running away trying to find a path to something good for yourself.
If this is not faith then what is? Until we met each other we never knew that we were the missing piece that completes each other's puzzle. We were meant to meet that day. I didn’t want to go the govt office that day. From the wait on the line to the chase at the airport we had our fairy tale.
But you had to go back to your reality and me to mine & it made us hopeless. You wanted to forget me cause you felt you cheated on the guy you hope for coming back, while I rejected someone else because I have hope you'll come back again.
Your mind is racing and so is mine. I'm over thinking and so are you. You're trying to numb the pain so am I. It almost feels like fate played a joke on us and we both feel fooled. The circumstances didn’t let us stay and now we don't want to leave either no matter how hard we try. But fate is testing us, it showed us what we could have if we were willing to work for it. If it were just a joke then we wouldn’t have felt the way we felt those moments we were by each others side. Somehow it felt destined and because of what you went through in life you feel that even if we try we'll fail and because of what I went through in life I have hope but I'm too scared to try because you're already trying to be away and I fear that my efforts will just make you go away and the lil thread that holds us because of those days will get cut. 
Neither of us is able to walk away because it felt too good to let go.
But now, I don’t want the circle to go on again, the circle of the unknown for the question yes it will happen or no it wont happen. You and I have both been through our share of tough time, but I am tired of only having to experience the tough times, I want the good experiences. I'm tired of feeling sorry for myself. I'm tired of people around me feeling nothing but sorry for me.
Even though as brief as it was the moments we had together was nothing short of divine. 
I stand by the hope that was shown to us by fate and while you choose to walk away because it scares you. I don't want to tell you what you should do, you already know what you need to do yet because of the past its scary, it's difficult you and I understand but ask yourself this "How long are you prepared to drown in self loath in self pity feeling sorry for youself because of something that didn’t work in the past. The storm will pass. You don't need to fear, you don’t need to run away, you don’t need to hide. It's going to be Ok this time. Because this time it felt different to you, you can lie to yourself but deep down you know its true. We both felt a soulmate vibe with each other and soulmates aren’t supposed to separate.
"affno lagi, affno khusi ko lagi affai le garne ho arule gardincha vanera assh gardine haina".
"Ma mero khusi ko lagi haat agadi badhau dai chu, tara ma affu lai bachauna aghi badna taiyar pani chu. Feri khassne mann chaina malai tyo purano khalto ma jaha maile yeti ka barsa bitaye."
Timi soch chau timi vagera, timi le birsera timlae affulai bachau dai chau jhun thik cha jayaz kura ho tara yeso garera timi aghi badheko haina timi feri tye khalto ma khasna jadai chau the only difference is yespali tyo khalto jhan gahiro hunecha.
Jhun halat ma hami dherai berr baseko huncha tye hami lai secure lagcha kina vane tyo familiar cha. Tara k ramro cha ra k toxic cha tyo ni chinna saknu parcha
jati familiar vaye ni yedi if its not good for you, and if it makes you miss your chance at happiness that you so much desired then agadi hidnu sakchu parcha to something new.
What if doesn't work out isn’t the right question you should be asking yourself. How long will you suffer? How long will you say that you're Ok where you are when you know it in your heart that its all just a lie you tell yourself to protect yourself.
What if it works out? And you find and get everything you ever wanted all your life and you just end up happy for the rest of your life.
every1 who was supposed to love u instead only hurt u which put u in a toxic prison. U know it yourself that U have had enough trauma n pain 4 one lifetime n that's all you knew all your life. u trusted me with sum of ur past info.. did i leave ta? i 'm here cheering for u... Team "R". 
the 1st time we met, u were hurt, you were limping, people were pushing wasn't I there to protect U. even when the line shifted didn't let go, I called for u & had ur back the entire time right till the very end.
U might ask wats so diff this time, wats so special this time... we'll end up hurt anyways like the last time. This time, we made each other ask ourselves "where was this person all this time in my life? why didn't we meet sooner?" We needed to go through our own journey before and we weren't ready then. it wasn't the right time for us to meet 
Fate had us meet & come into each other's life that day. i had to take my father there, i wanted to go home but decided to wait for my turn as well & u were trying to find a way to a brighter future. 

i know its difficult for u & i will walk away if I'm the one causing you confusing from your past because i truly, deeply, unconditionally care for you and want u to heal and be happy and be treated with nothing but respect and dignity even if its not me.
For both of us we were never an option… We were for the both of us a choice we never knew had until now..
You need to reach out, try just a little. Open up a little, just take a step forward for now and slowly move forward I'm not going anywhere if you do. But I can't stay if you aren't willing to try. It's hurting me how you went cold after you flew back home. 
I have already hurt myself before for years waiting for that someone to come back. You are doing the exact same thing and I don't want to see you doing that. If you choose your past then I will pray they will come back to you. I wish for and pray for nothing but the best for you.
I've made my choice and its time for you to make yours. If it weren't hard then it wouldn't be worth it.
If u ever want to find me you know where i am and even if u can't find me, i know fate will guide u to me just as it did that day. 
You told me to wait and I'm waiting. But just reach out and we can fly away together far away where no one can hurt us anymore, a place where nothing but happiness awaits us, a place where we can build our own beautiful world but
I can't wait forever not again, the thought of losing you is too much

"i'm glad i met you R".✌️⛑
